    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>MIGRATE â€“ MIGRation pATterns in Europe</b> is a Web mapping application aimed at educating and raising awareness about the phenomenon of migration in Europe. This goal is achieved using a gamification approach, that means you will interact with the application by playing a map-based game, where questions are asked and answers are provided and explained about a number of topics related to migration. Your answers will help to understand the current knowledge and perception of migration-related issues. The source code of MIGRATE can be accessed <a href="https://bitbucket.org/kilsedar/migrate/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Each time you play, you will be asked 6 questions of different types: true/false questions, multiple choice questions, text-based questions (where you are required to enter a numerical value) and map-based questions (where you are required to select a country on the map). You will have only 30 seconds to answer each question. Questions will be focused on Europe. If you come from Europe, parts of the questions are customized according to the country you come from. Below you can play a short video showing how to play MIGRATE.</p>
